 <h5>Act 4 -_ Morning-room at Sir Robert Chiltern’s house_.</h5>
<p>   
  <h6>LORD CAVERSHAM.</h6> <p> Well, sir, what are you doing here? Wasting your time
  as usual, I suppose?</p>

  <h6>LORD GORING.</h6>  <p class="stage-directoin">[_Throws down paper and rises_.]</p> <p>My dear father, when one
    pays a visit it is for the purpose of wasting other people’s time, notone’s own.</p>

  <h6>LORD CAVERSHAM.</h6>  <p>Have you been thinking over what I spoke to you about
    last night?</p>

  <h6>LORD GORING.</h6>  <p>I have been thinking about nothing else.</p>

  <h6>LORD CAVERSHAM.</h6>  <p>Engaged to be married yet?
  </p>

  <h6>LORD GORING.</h6>  <p class="stage direction">[_Genially_.]</p> <p> Not yet: but I hope to be before lunch-time.</p>

  <h6>LORD CAVERSHAM.</h6>  <p class="stage direction">[_Caustically_.]</p> <p></p>You can have till dinner-time if it
    would be of any convenience to you</p>

  <h6>LORD GORING.</h6>  <p>Thanks awfully, but I think I’d sooner be engaged before
    lunch.</p>

  <h6>LORD CAVERSHAM.</h6>  <p>Humph!  Never know when you are serious or not.</p>

  <h6>LORD GORING.</h6>  <p>Neither do I, father</p1>
