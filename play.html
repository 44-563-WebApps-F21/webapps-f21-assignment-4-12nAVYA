    <h5>Act 4 -_ Morning-room at Sir Robert Chiltern’s house_.</h5>
    <p1>
        LORD CAVERSHAM.  Well, sir, what are you doing here?  Wasting your time
as usual, I suppose?
<br>
LORD GORING.  [_Throws down paper and rises_.]  My dear father, when one
pays a visit it is for the purpose of wasting other people’s time, not
one’s own.
<br>
LORD CAVERSHAM.  Have you been thinking over what I spoke to you about
last night?
<br>
LORD GORING.  I have been thinking about nothing else.
<br>
LORD CAVERSHAM.  Engaged to be married yet?
<br>
LORD GORING.  [_Genially_.]  Not yet: but I hope to be before lunch-time.
<br>
LORD CAVERSHAM.  [_Caustically_.]  You can have till dinner-time if it
would be of any convenience to you.
<br>
LORD GORING.  Thanks awfully, but I think I’d sooner be engaged before
lunch.
<br>
LORD CAVERSHAM.  Humph!  Never know when you are serious or not.
<br>
LORD GORING.  Neither do I, father</p1>
